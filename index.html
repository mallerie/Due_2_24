    The Best
  </h3>
    
    <ol>
      <li class="whitebackground best">
      Mulan
      <div>
        <img width="300" alt="Mulan is balanced on a roof, with her sword in hand ready for combat." title="You don't want any of this!" src="http://www.hercampus.com/sites/default/files/2015/01/16/mulan.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>
        As if <a href="http://www.hercampus.com/entertainment/13-reasons-why-mulan-most-badass-disney-princess">these reasons</a> aren't enough, Mulan makes the top of the list because she does it all. She is dedicated to her family and friends, who can
        rely on her when they need to. Don't forget, though, that this girl saved China. It doesn't get more bad ass than a woman saving the most populous country on earth.

    </li>

    <li class="best">
      Tiana
      <div>
        <img width="300" alt="picture" src="http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/32100000/Disney-Princess-Screencaps-Princess-Tiana-disney-princess-32182088-2560-1440.jpg">
      </div>

      <p>
        We could write a book about what makes Tiana a great role model, but we know you have many other role models to learn about so we will leave you with this. Some say Tiana is one of the <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/louispeitzman/reasons-tiana-is-the-most-underrated-disney-princess#.jkOKRobPd">most underated</a>        Disney princesses, and we agree. She is hard-working, independent, devoted to family and supports her community all at the same time. There aint nothin like a self-made woman.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li class="whitebackground best">
      Pocahantas
      <div>
        <img width="300" alt="picture"  src="http://i.imgur.com/Ug7r2iC.jpg"> 
      </div> 
      
      <p>
        How can anyone deny the awesomeness that is Pocahantas? She is fierce, strong, wise and brave. Though disney made a few mistakes with the historical acurateness of this film, Pocahantas still
        makes it to the top three. Learn more <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2015/06/23/13-reasons-why-pocahontas-is-the-perfect-disney-role-model-5256301/">here.</a>

    <li class="best">
      Sheriff Woody
      <div>
        <img width="200" alt="picture" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/Sheriff_Woody.png">
      </div>
      <p>
         Woody made the list because not only is he hard-working and a dedicated leader of the toys, he even made Fortune magazine's <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/03/20/fortunes-worlds-best-leaders-20-of-hollywoods-greatest-leaders/"> World's Best Leaders</a> list.

    <li class="whitebackground best">
      James P. Sullivan
      <div>
        <img width="300" alt="picture" src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/disney-fan/images/6/67/Sulley-_2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140530182616">
      </div>
      <p>
        Sulley is a great friend, fun to be around and is great with children. He makes the list because of how he shines at work. 
      </p>
    </li>

    <li class="best">
      Mr. Incredible
      <div>
        <img width="300" alt="picture" src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/rise-of-the-brave-tangled-dragons/images/2/21/The-Incredibles-_Bob_Parr.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150225012814">
      </div>
      <p>
        Great dad, hero and leader. He had to overcome his ego in order to work with the other Supers to save the day. And he saved his family and the city in the process.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li class="whitebackground best">
      Dory
      <div>
        <img width="300" alt="picture" src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/e/ef/Dory-FN.png/revision/latest?cb=20131111070226">
      </div>
      <p>
        Though her memory is all but useless, Dory makes the best sidekick anyone could ask for. She is loyal, sometimes dependable, and cares about family.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li class="best">
      Jessie
      <div>
        <img width="200" alt="picture" src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/p__/images/1/1c/Disney_INFINITY_-_Jessie.png/revision/latest?cb=20150923002351&path-prefix=protagonist">
      </div>
      <p>
        Jessie is definitely a fan favorite, and for a good reason, too. She is kind, loyal and funny and playful. There are even<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/spenceralthouse/this-new-theory-about-toy-story-will-blow-your-mind#.miJmGEjPp">theories </a> about where her character comes from that will blow your mind. 
      </p>
    </li>

    <li class="whitebackground best">
      Carl Fredricksen
      <div>
        <img width="300" alt="picture" src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/pixar/images/7/71/Carl.png/revision/latest?cb=20110416122644">
      </div>
      <p>
        Carl warmed our hearts when he found himself again after the death of his wife. He is a role model to us all that life truly can go on.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li class="best">
      Bruce (From Finding Nemo)
      <div>
        <img width="300" alt="picture" src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/2/28/Finding_Nemo(21).jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130729224229">
      </div>
      <p>
        Bruce made the list despite his short comings. He makes a good role model for his work in encouraging other sharks to see their fish neighbors as friends, not as food. He's so cool that <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3356094/Hello-maaaate-Smiling-shark-looks-just-like-Bruce-Finding-Nemo-emerges-deep-flash-pearly-whites.html">real sharks</a>        even want to look like him.

    The Worst 
  </h3>
	<div class="div2">
	  <ol>
	    <li class="whitebackground worst">
	      Syndrome
	      <div>
	        <img width="300" alt="picture" src="http://a.dilcdn.com/bl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/11/Incredibles_hair.jpg">
	      </div>
	      <p>
	        Syndrome is just a bad guy. Even when he was given a chance to be good, he didn't take it. 
	      </p>
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      Evil Emperor Zurg
	      <div>
	        <img width="300" alt="picture" src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/pixar/images/7/76/Toy_Story_2_-_Zurg.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100609130410">
	      </div>
	      <p>
	        As long as his batteries are charged, this guy is out to do evil. He thrives off of hurting other toys and that aint cool.
	      </p>
	    </li>

	    <li class="whitebackground">
	      Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear (From Toy Story 3)
	      <div>
	        <img width="300" alt="picture" src="http://lovethebadguy.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/lotso.jpg">
	      </div>
	      <p>
	        Aside from being super scary, Huggin' Bear is a bad role model because he uses his innocent looks to fool unsuspecting toys into trusting him. 
	      </p>
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      Hopper
	      <div>
	        <img width="300" alt="picture" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8jkNNNRkYlM/maxresdefault.jpg">
	      </div>
	      <p>
	        Hopper is just plain bad. He has no problem killing ants, which is sad.
	      </p>
	    </li>

	    <li class="whitebackground">
	      Stinky Pete (From Toy Story 2)
	      <div>
	        <img width="300" alt="picture" src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/2/2a/Stinky_Pete_the_Prospector.png/revision/latest?cb=20121018144434">
	      </div>
	      <p>
	        We all thought Stinky Pete would turn out to be a good father-figure for Andy, but he had other plans in mind.
	      </p>
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      Scar (The Lion King)
	      <div>
	        <img width="300" alt="picture" src="http://a.dilcdn.com/bl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/03/Scar.png">
	      </div>
	      <p>
	        There is nothing worse than being betrayed by family. Nothing. Scar is a bad role model because he killed his brother, Mufasa.
	      </p>
	    </li>

	    <li class="whitebackground">
	      Ursula
	      <div>
	        <img width="300" alt="picture" src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/f/fe/Ursula_KH.png/revision/latest?cb=20130202052503">
	      </div>
	      <p>
	        Ursula made the list because she actually enjoys being bad. Remember when she took Ariel's voice? That was fun for her. Bad things shouldn't be fun.
	      </p>
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      Shan Yu
	      <div>
	        <img width="300" alt="picture" src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/4/40/Shan_Yu.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151017015229">
	      </div>
	      <p>
	        Shan Yu invaded China and tried to take over the empire, killing hundreds of innocent people in the process. Shame on you, Shan Yu.
	      </p>
	    </li>

	    <li class="whitebackground">
	      Hans
	      <div>
	        <img width="300" alt="picture" src="http://40.media.tumblr.com/3cd4b0146b2491d1a7ec127e1362726d/tumblr_n26dchGLfS1r94mgyo4_500.png">
	      </div>
	      <p>
	        Hans gained Anna's trust, only to betray her in the end. Not cool, dude.
	      </p>
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      Maleficent
	      <div>
	        <img width="300" alt="picture" src="http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sleeping-beauty3.jpg">
	      </div>
	      <p>
	        Maleficent poisoned Sleeping Beauty and tried to kill her all because she wasn't invited to the christening!
	      </p>
	    </li>
